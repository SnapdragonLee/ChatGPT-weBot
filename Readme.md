## Default configs (Follow steps before you start server)

---> Configurable options [detailed guide](./doc/Config.md)





## Step to Start
0. Environment: Windows 7+， python 3.7+

1. Install all packages listed in `requirements.txt` , use the command like:

   ```
   pip install -r ./requirements.txt
   ```

   

2. Download package from Github Releases.

3. Install `WeChat-3.6.0.18.exe` on your computer, **if your version is higher than 3.6.0.18, you can downgrade instantly.** Then get your account online. You can also download zip version of WeChat. **If you wanna dual-call WeChat, modify `./dual-start.bat` file guiding by annotation.**

   

4. Monitoring WeChat message by running a server. Here are two methods to achieve this, **please *choose 1 method*** :

   - Using injector named `DLLinjector_V1.0.3.exe`, then choose file named `3.6.0.18-0.0.0.008.dll` to inject.

   - Running `funtool_3.6.0.18-1.0.0013.exe` , and press `Start` .

5. The last step is fill json files listed in `.config/` . 

   - In `api_config.json`, you need to fill in your own parameter settings for API calls. If you don’t know the specific parameters, you only need to fill in the "api_key" and optional "proxy" items.

   - In `server_config.json`, you can customize the listening address and port. If you don’t know it exactly, no modification needed by default.

   - In `config.json` ,  you need to configure your custom options based on your preferences.

   - In `sys_character.json`, you can customize the character the bot needs to play, and use the command to activate when chatting.

   - **(Temporary deprecated)** In `rev_config.json` , you need to fill your ChatGPT login information by *choosing 1 method*: 

     - Email/Password **(Not supported for Google/Microsoft accounts)**

     - session_token **(supported for Google/Microsoft accounts)**

       > 1. Go to [`chat.openai.com/chat`](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and log in or sign up.
       > 2. Press `F12` to open dev tools.
       > 3. Copy cookies as `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` .

     

6. Run `main.py` by using command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   **Everything is ready, feel free to go online with your ChatGPT-weBot !** 
   
   No limitation, but since switching to OpenAI API, there are usage counts and payment requirements.
